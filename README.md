> [reading the test outputs](https://github.com/DCI-EdTech/autograding-setup/wiki/Reading-test-outputs)

There are two ways to see why tasks might not be completed:
#### 1. Running tests locally
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test` in the terminal. You will see where your solution differs from the expected result.
